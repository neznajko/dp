Design Patterns from various books:

- jdp, Java Design Patterns
- didp, Dive Into Design Patterns
- gpp, Game Programming Patterns
- CGPT

Yea, I just wanted to learn *dp* and my first examples were
from the books above. But this is very boring so I've tried
to think of new scenarios by myself. And if I can give you an 
advice is exactly this, try to understand the patterns by reading
from various sources, and then for the actual implementations,
try to think for your own scenarios, this is more fun and will
really help you to understand the patterns
