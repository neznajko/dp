# GoF Definition
Moonlight on the lake,  
Ripples dance with silver light,  
Night hums soft and clear.  

This is not a ***GoF*** design pattern, but we get a Haiku from CGPT anyway.
So as we've discussed already in the *Factory Method Pattern* the main
issue here is that, if we want to extend the factory to produce new products
we have to modify the static method responsible for creating the new products,
which is a violation of the *Open-Closed, **SOLID*** principle
