# GoF Definition
Eyes meet, souls align,  
Algorithm of a thousand dreams,  
Time stands still for us.

At some point if there are too many patterns I'll have
to return to the Red Circle and Blue Rectangle type of
examples, cos I'm running out of ideas! This is the
*Template Pattern*, it's an easy one, so no need for fancy
scenarios here, I hope

If you think about our life, it more or less follows a
certain scheme like:

 1. Go to Kindergarten
 2. Go to School
 3. Get a diploma from an University
 4. Find a job
 5. Create a family
 6. Continuer à répéter

So basically this is it, we have an abstract class
that has a recipe as a sequence of steps ( abstract methods ),
and concrete implementations that override them
